# Cloud-Security-Monitoring-System-on-AWS
This project demonstrates the implementation of a robust, automated monitoring and alerting system within an AWS environment. The primary goal is to track access to sensitive credentials such as API keys and database passwords and provide real time notifications whenever these "secrets" are retrieved.
